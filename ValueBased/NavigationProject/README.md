# Navigation Project
I will train an agent to navigate in large square world.
## The goal of my agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possbile while avoiding blue bananas.

- Reward = +1 for a yellow banana.
- Reward = -1 for a blue banana.

- The state space: 37 dimension
- The agent's velocity

For discrete actions
- 0: move forward
- 1: move backward
- 2: turn left
- 3: turn right
